# Stanford_RNA-3d-structure-prediction
Machine learning based project for predicting RNA three dimensional structures directly from nucleotide sequences, developed for the Stanford RNA 3D Folding Kaggle competition. The work focuses on sequence to structure modeling, deep learning techniques, multiple structure sampling, and TM score based evaluation for accurate RNA folding prediction.
